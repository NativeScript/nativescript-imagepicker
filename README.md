Imagepicker plugin supporting both single and multiple selection.
<br />Plugin supports **iOS8+** and uses [QBImagePicker](https://github.com/questbeat/QBImagePicker) cocoa pod.
<br />For **Android** it uses Intents to open the stock images or file pickers. For Android 6 (API 23) and above the permissions to read file storage should be explicitly required. See demo for implementation details.

## Installation

In Command prompt / Terminal navigate to your application root folder and run:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-imagepicker
tns run
```

## Configuration
No additional configuration required!

## Migrating from 5.x.x to 6.x.x
With version **6.x.x** the dependency to the `nativescript-ui-listview` plugin is removed and for iOS the [QBImagePicker](https://github.com/questbeat/QBImagePicker) cocoa pod is used. Now the plugin supports some new features, fixes some bugs and has a more native look in iOS. You should remove any dependencies to `nativescript-pro-ui`, `nativescript-ui-listview`, etc. in case you've added them in your app specifically for this plugin. Also the options **fileUri**, **doneText**, **cancelText**, **albumsText**, **newestFirst** and the methods **cancel()** and **done()** are no longer applicable. The image picker now returns the basic [{N} ImageAsset class](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/tree/master/tns-core-modules/image-asset) (and not custom asset as before). If you have been using the `fileUri` property of the returned assets to get a file path in versions prior to 6.x.x, you should refer to the following issue comment for an alternative way to get the path - https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-imagepicker/issues/181#issuecomment-384585293.

## Migrating from 4.x.x to 5.x.x
With version **5.x.x** major update to the plugin there is a related dependency which needs to be updated inside your project. The plugin uses internally the `nativescript-ui-listview` plugin (part of the NativeScript Pro UI components). Recently the monolithic [NativeScript Pro UI plugin was split in multiple plugins](https://www.nativescript.org/blog/professional-components-from-nativescript-ui-the-big-breakup), each of them representing a single component. Now, instead of the monolithic package, nativescript-imagepicker uses only the component it needs. To use version 5.x.x of the plugin, you need to update any dependencies to `nativescript-pro-ui` in your project with the single component alternatives as described in the [migration guide](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/migration).

## Migrating from 3.x.x to 4.x.x
With the **4.x.x** major update to the plugin there is a related dependency which needs to be updated inside your project. The plugin uses internally the `nativescript-pro-ui` plugin (previously known as `nativescript-telerik-ui`) which has bee updated and made 100% free. This means that if your project is using the deprecated `nativescript-telerik-ui`/`pro` plugins adding the latest version of the `nativescript-imagepicker` plugin will cause your project to throw an build error when working with iOS. This is because the `nativescript-imagepicker` has a dependency to the new `nativescript-pro-ui` plugin and when your project also depends on the old `nativescript-telerik-ui` plugin there is a native frameworks collision.

In order to solve this you simply have to update to the latest `nativescript-pro-ui`, more details on how to migrate from `nativescript-telerik-ui`/`pro` to `nativescript-pro-ui` can be found [here](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/nativescript-ui/migration).

## Usage 

The best way to explore the usage of the plugin is to inspect both demo apps in the plugin repository. 
In `demo` folder you can find the usage of the plugin for TypeScript non-Angular application. Refer to `demo/app/main-page.ts`.
In `demo-angular` is the usage in an Angular app. Refer to `demo-angular/app/app.component.ts`.

In addition to the plugin usage, both apps are webpack configured.

In short here are the steps:

### Import the plugin

*TypeScript*
``` 
import * as imagepicker from "nativescript-imagepicker";
```

*Javascript*
``` 
var imagepicker = require("nativescript-imagepicker");
```

### Create imagepicker

Create imagepicker in `single` or `multiple` mode to specifiy if the imagepicker will be used for single or multiple selection of images

*TypeScript*
``` 
let context = imagepicker.create({
    mode: "single" // use "multiple" for multiple selection
});
````

*Javascript*
````
var context = imagepicker.create({ mode: "single" }); // use "multiple" for multiple selection
````

### Request permissions, show the images list and process the selection

``` 
context
    .authorize()
    .then(function() {
        return context.present();
    })
    .then(function(selection) {
        selection.forEach(function(selected) {
            // process the selected image
        });
        list.items = selection;
    }).catch(function (e) {
        // process error
    });
```

> **NOTE**: To request permissions for Android 6+ (API 23+) we use [nativescript-permissions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-permissions).

> **NOTE**: Using the plugin on iOS requres photo library permission. Your app might be rejected from the Apple App Store if you do not provide a description about why you need this permission. The default message "Requires access to photo library." might not be enough for the App Store reviewers. You can customize it by editing the `app/App_Resources/iOS/Info.plist` file in your app and adding the following key:

```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>Description text goes here</string>
```

## API
