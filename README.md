Imagepicker plugin supporting both single and multiple selection.
<br />Plugin supports **iOS8+** and uses [Photos Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios//documentation/Photos/Reference/Photos_Framework/index.html).
<br />For **Android** it uses Intents to open the stock images or file pickers. For Android 6 (API 23) and above the permissions to read file storage should be explicitly required. See demo for implementation details.

## Installation

In Command prompt / Terminal navigate to your application root folder and run:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-imagepicker
```

## Usage 

The best way to explore the usage of the plugin is to inspect both demo apps in the plugin repository. 
In `demo` folder you can find the usage of the plugin for TypeScript non-Angular application. Refer to `demo/app/main-page.ts`.
In `demo-angular` is the usage in an Angular app. Refer to `demo-angular/app/app.component.ts`.

In addition to the plugin usage, both apps are webpack configured.

In short here are the steps:

### Import the plugin

*TypeScript*
``` 
import * as imagepicker from "nativescript-imagepicker";
```

*Javascript*
``` 
var imagepicker = require("nativescript-imagepicker");
```

### Create imagepicker

Create imagepicker in `single` or `multiple` mode to specifiy if the imagepicker will be used for single or multiple selection of images

*TypeScript*
``` 
let context = imagepicker.create({
    mode: "single" // use "multiple" for multiple selection
});
````

*Javascript*
````
var context = imagepicker.create({ mode: "single" }); // use "multiple" for multiple selection
````

### Request permissions, show the images list and process the selection

``` 
context
    .authorize()
    .then(function() {
        return context.present();
    })
    .then(function(selection) {
        selection.forEach(function(selected) {
            // process the selected image
        });
        list.items = selection;
    }).catch(function (e) {
        // process error
    });
```

> **NOTE**: To request permissions for Android 6+ (API 23+) we use [nativescript-permissions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nativescript-permissions).
